    5. Transfer dough onto a well-floured surface, and knead gently until it forms a cohesive ball. \
    6. Portion off approximately 1 ½ Tbsp-sized pieces of dough and roll into smooth, tight balls. Set aside. \
    7. Prepare your cinnamon/sugar mixture for rolling by stirring together cinnamon and sugar in a small dish. Set aside. \

    9. Fry donut holes for approximately 90 seconds*, turning half way through so they become evenly golden brown. \
    10. Remove carefully. Allow them to sit for about a minute/until no longer too hot to touch, and then transfer them to your cinnamon/sugar dish, roll them in the mixture until fully covered. "};
